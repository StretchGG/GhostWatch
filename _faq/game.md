faqs:
    - question: What game engine are they using?
      answer: Unreal Engine 5.
    - question: How will game servers work? Will I have to choose one or worry about where my friends are playing?
      answer: No. There will be servers behind the scenes, but from what they’ve said so far, you won’t have to pick one. The game will automatically connect you to the best available server for your location, but you’ll still be able to play with players from different regions or locations without restrictions.
    - question: What are Red, Blue & Yellow zones?
      answer: Red Zones will be more like your typical MMO zones. You'll see other players, there will be quests and events to do around the map, etc. <br><br>Blue Zones are randomly generated, instanced zones for solo or group play. <br><br>Yellow Zones will be the city hub.
    - question: Will there be player housing?
      answer: Yes. From what they talked about, it seems like it will be tied into Blue Zones. If you find a Blue Zone you like, you can keep it and set that as your 'home shard' and build it up.
    - question: Will there be crafting & gathering?
      answer: Yes.
    - question: Will there be mounts?
      answer: From what it sounds like so far, everyone will have their own airship which they will be able to customise. This will be used to get to the Blue Zones. As for Red Zone mounts, it is undecided yet.
    - question: Will there be PvP?
      answer: Yes. They haven't talked about how it would take shape but they did say they were playing around with the idea of PvP Blue Zones for people who want to PvP.
